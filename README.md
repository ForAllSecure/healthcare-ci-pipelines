# Healthcare CI Pipelines

## Overview

This project is an open-source collection of Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines designed to streamline the development of secure and compliant healthcare software. This project provides CI pipeline configurations that automatically enforce security best practices and compliance standards pertinent to the healthcare industry. Our goal is to enable rapid integration, testing, and delivery of software that meets stringent regulatory requirements.

## Features

- **Pre-configured Pipelines**: Ready-to-use workflows for common healthcare software scenarios.
- **Compliance as Code**: Ensures that every build adheres to predefined regulatory standards.
- **Security Checks**: Integrates security scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities early.
- **Automated Testing**: Supports unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically generates compliance and technical documentation.
- **Notification System**: Alerts for build status, security vulnerabilities, and compliance deviations.

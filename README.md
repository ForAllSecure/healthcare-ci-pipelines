# Healthcare CI Pipelines

## Overview

This project is an open-source collection of Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines designed to streamline the development of secure and compliant healthcare software. This project provides CI pipeline configurations that automatically enforce security best practices and compliance standards pertinent to the healthcare industry. Our goal is to enable rapid integration, testing, and delivery of software that meets stringent regulatory requirements.

## Features

- **Pre-configured Pipelines**: Ready-to-use workflows for common healthcare software scenarios.
- **Compliance as Code**: Ensures that every build adheres to predefined regulatory standards.
- **Security Checks**: Integrates security scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities early.
- **Automated Testing**: Supports unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically generates compliance and technical documentation.
- **Notification System**: Alerts for build status, security vulnerabilities, and compliance deviations.
- **Free**: All pipelines are based on freely available tools up to certain usage thresholds.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-ci-pipeline.git
cd healthcare-ci-pipeline
```

## Integration

All pipelines within this repo implement standalone security checks that pass/fail and generate reports. The generic integration pattern looks as follows:


```mermaid

  Develop[Developer]
  Commit[Push Changes]
  Test[Security Check]
  Report[Certificate]
  Release[Release]
  Pass[Check Passed]
  subgraph SDLC
    start[ ] --> Develop
    Develop --> Commit
    Commit --> Test
    Test --> Pass
    Pass --> Release
    Pass --> Report
  end
  Test -->| Check Failed |Develop

Integration within your project's CI system may differ depending on the platform and code development flow you use.
